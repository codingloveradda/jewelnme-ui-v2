                    <h2>4. Ruthenium</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>It is a silver-coloured, hard metal that is mainly used in electronics. Ruthenium was discovered
                            in
                            the Russian Urals in 1844. Today, this precious metal is still mined the most there, besides
                            North
                            and South America.</p>
                        <p>Ruthenium is also used in jewellery. Ruthenium is added especially in platinum
                            and palladium jewellery. This makes them a little more expensive, but also much sturdier.</p>

                        <p>
                            This precious metal has a blue grey colour and in powder form, it reacts very strongly with
                            oxygen. As a result, it stinks (the word osmium is also derived from the Greek osm√®, which means
                            'stench') and is also very toxic. So, not the kind of precious metal you want to wear in a ring
                            around your fingers...

                        <p>
                            This precious metal has a very high density, so it weighs relatively much. In industry, the
                            metal is highly sought after for its hardness, durability and high melting temperature. It is
                            rare in the earth's crust, but often found in meteorites. Like ruthenium, iridium is often used
                            to make platinum firmer.

                            With palladium, another silver-coloured substance, we are getting a little closer to the types
                            of precious metals most people think of right away. Some jewellery is made of pure palladium,
                            although it is very soft and light. But in jewellery-making, palladium is mainly used as an
                            addition to gold, to achieve white gold.

                    <h2>8. Rhodium</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Rhodium is a silver white (more white than silver), very hard metal, which is very rare. In
                            nature it usually occurs mixed with gold, platinum or palladium. Filtering pure rhodium is an
                            expensive, complicated process. Once again, most sites are located in the Russian Urals, and
                            less than 25 tonnes are mined annually. By comparison, in 2018, the total global gold production
                            was 3,260 tonnes. The favourable physical properties of this metal combined with its rarity
                            makes this the most expensive precious metal in the world.</p>
                        <p>Rhodium is applied very thinly to
                            white gold jewellery for the hardness and exceptional colour. White gold by itself still has a
                            yellowish appearance. This process is called rhodation.</p>
                        <p>Other metals such as magnesium, copper or titanium are not precious metals. </p>
